                <p>I am a student of full stack web development at Austin Coding Academy.
                Before starting at Austin Coding Academy I taught bilingual pre-k and kindergarten for 6 years,
                and took on the role of Campus Innovation Coach at my school. This meant going out and researching
                various robotics and technology resources that our students could use in the classroom to learn
                or develop skills that they weren't getting from the curriculum. I discovered that I really enjoy
                robotics and coding, and also that there is a lack of apps available to bilingual students with special
                needs. I am passionate about finding ways to make technology more accessible for little kids, easier to
                implement for teachers, and ways to improve problem-solving and social emotional skills through
                collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                In my spare time I love to move, which is fortunately very easy in Austin. You
                can find me hiking or camping in one of our beautiful parks, or kayaking and
                swimming in our numerous swimming holes. In the colder months (which, let's 
                be honest, it's not that cold) I catch up on reading, go dancing, or hibernate.
